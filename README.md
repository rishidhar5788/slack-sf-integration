# slack-sf-integration

# Logic to get the salesforce case details to
# show  up in slack using following custom slash command:

# 1. '/demo-sf {SF case number}' - to show details of a salesforce case
# 2. '/demo-sf date={YYYY-MM-DD}' - to show a very high level reporting 
# 	  insight along with the case data in "demo-channels" slack channel
# 	  for the cases that are created after the entered date in "YYYY-MM-DD" format
